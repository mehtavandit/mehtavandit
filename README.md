## 🚀 Projects

### [Pneumonia Detection using Chest X-Rays leveraging CNNs](https://github.com/mehtavandit/COMP6721-GroupP)
**Description:** This project aims to detect and classify pneumonia using chest X-rays through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to improve pneumonia diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained healthcare settings, where accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial.

**Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, Pandas, Numpy, PyTorch, torchvision, matplotlib, numpy

### [Architecting Scalable Distributed Systems: Leveraging AWS EKS, S3, Amazon ECR, Docker, and Kubernetes](https://github.com/JSM2512/Distributed_System_Design_Final_Project)
**Description:** n this project, we dive into the principles and practices of distributed system design, utilizing a suite of advanced technologies to build and manage scalable, reliable, and efficient systems. Our approach leverages Amazon Web Services (AWS) tools, containerization with Docker, and Kubernetes orchestration to demonstrate key concepts in the field.

**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Boto3, Pandas, AWS EKS, AWS S3, AWS ECR, Docker, Kubernetes

### [Ford-Fulkerson Simulation with Various Augmenting Algorithms](https://github.com/mehtavandit/ALGO-Project)
**Description:** This project implements a simulation of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for maximum flow in a network. The simulation includes the use of different augmenting path algorithms such as Shortest Augmenting Path (SAP), Depth-First Search (DFS), Maximum Capacity (MaxCap), and a Random augmenting path algorithm. The goal is to analyze the performance of these algorithms under varying graph conditions and provide insights into their efficiency and characteristics.

Tech Stack: Python, csv, random, heapq, time, collections, math

### [Drug Target Interaction and Water Solubility Models](https://github.com/yourusername/project1)
**Description:** Computation prediction of drug target interaction (DTI) and its solubility in water is vital for drug discovery. This project implements a research paper, "Estimating Aqueous Solubility Directly from Molecular Structure," by John S. Delaney.

**Tech Stack:** Python, AWS, Streamlit, Pycaret, RDkit, MySQL, Pandas, Numpy

### [Attendance System Using Facial Recognition](https://github.com/mehtavandit/Attendance-Face-Detection)
**Description:** Engineered a user-friendly application that integrates with a facial recognition system, providing real-time attendance data and comprehensive reporting features, minimizing the spread of coronavirus during the pandemic.

**Tech Stack:** Python, OpenCV, Dlib, Tkinter, Face detection libraries

## üöÄ Projects

### [Pneumonia Detection using Chest X-Rays leveraging CNNs](https://github.com/yourusername/project3)
**Description:** This project aims to detect and classify pneumonia using chest X-rays through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to improve pneumonia diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained healthcare settings, where accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial.

**Introduction:** Pneumonia is a prevalent respiratory infection, often requiring chest X-rays for diagnosis. However, skilled interpretation and resource shortages can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment. This project explores using CNNs for automated pneumonia detection.

**Methodology:**
- **Datasets:** 
  - Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia) by Paul Mooney (2018)
  - COVID-19 X-ray (2 proposed databases) by Edoardo Vantaggiato (2020)
  - NIH Chest X-rays by National Institutes of Health (NIH) (2017)
- **CNN Models:** ResNet18, DenseNet121, InceptionV3
- **Optimization Algorithm:** Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001, batch size of 30, and cross-entropy loss function.

**Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

**Results:** InceptionV3 consistently outperformed ResNet-18 and DenseNet-121 across all datasets. Higher accuracy and metric scores were observed with fewer classes, suggesting simpler tasks facilitate better feature learning.

**Conclusion:** InceptionV3 showed robust learning and generalization capabilities across datasets. However, its computational complexity poses challenges for resource-constrained environments.

**Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, Pandas, Numpy

### [Drug Target Interaction and Water Solubility Models](https://github.com/yourusername/project1)
**Description:** Computation prediction of drug target interaction (DTI) and its solubility in water is vital for drug discovery. This project implements a research paper, "Estimating Aqueous Solubility Directly from Molecular Structure," by John S. Delaney.

**Tech Stack:** Python, AWS, Streamlit, Pycaret, RDkit, MySQL, Pandas, Numpy

### [Attendance System Using Facial Recognition](https://github.com/yourusername/project2)
**Description:** Engineered a user-friendly application that integrates with a facial recognition system, providing real-time attendance data and comprehensive reporting features, minimizing the spread of coronavirus during the pandemic.

**Tech Stack:** Python, OpenCV, Dlib, Tkinter, Face detection libraries

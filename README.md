## 🚀 Projects

### [Pneumonia Detection using Chest X-Rays leveraging CNNs]([https://github.com/yourusername/project3](https://github.com/mehtavandit/COMP6721-GroupP))
**Description:** This project aims to detect and classify pneumonia using chest X-rays through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to improve pneumonia diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained healthcare settings, where accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial.

**Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, Pandas, Numpy, PyTorch, torchvision, matplotlib, numpy

### [Ford-Fulkerson Simulation with Various Augmenting Algorithms](https://github.com/mehtavandit/ALGO-Project))
**Description:** This project implements a simulation of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm for maximum flow in a network. The simulation includes the use of different augmenting path algorithms such as Shortest Augmenting Path (SAP), Depth-First Search (DFS), Maximum Capacity (MaxCap), and a Random augmenting path algorithm. The goal is to analyze the performance of these algorithms under varying graph conditions and provide insights into their efficiency and characteristics.

Tech Stack: Python, csv, random, heapq, time, collections, math

### [Drug Target Interaction and Water Solubility Models](https://github.com/yourusername/project1)
**Description:** Computation prediction of drug target interaction (DTI) and its solubility in water is vital for drug discovery. This project implements a research paper, "Estimating Aqueous Solubility Directly from Molecular Structure," by John S. Delaney.

**Tech Stack:** Python, AWS, Streamlit, Pycaret, RDkit, MySQL, Pandas, Numpy

### [Attendance System Using Facial Recognition]([https://github.com/yourusername/project2](https://github.com/mehtavandit/Attendance-Face-Detection))
**Description:** Engineered a user-friendly application that integrates with a facial recognition system, providing real-time attendance data and comprehensive reporting features, minimizing the spread of coronavirus during the pandemic.

**Tech Stack:** Python, OpenCV, Dlib, Tkinter, Face detection libraries
